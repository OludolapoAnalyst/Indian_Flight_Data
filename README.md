# Indian_Flight_Data
The project analyzes a dataset of flight itineraries of 12 airlines on domestic Indian flights. The average price of tickets is Rs.9,048. The dataset contains basic information about each flight (such as date, time, departure airport, arrival airport, price, departure time, arrival time, route, and total stops). This dataset can be used to forecast the cost of flight tickets in India.

Some of the business questions: 
Which airline is the most expensive and which airline is the least expensive?
How many flights cost above the average ticket prices? What are the peculiarities of these flights?
How are the prices varied according to the number of stops?
How are the prices varied according to the flight routes?
Are the prices of flight tickets affected by the airline?
What is the longest duration covered per airline and how does duration affect ticket prices?
