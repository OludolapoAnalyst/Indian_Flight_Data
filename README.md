# Indian_Flight_Data
The project analyzes a dataset of flight itineraries of 12 airlines on domestic Indian flights. The average price of tickets is Rs.9,048. The dataset contains basic information about each flight (such as date, time, departure airport, arrival airport, price, departure time, arrival time, route, and total stops). This dataset can be used to forecast the cost of flight tickets in India.

Some of the business questions: 
Which airline is the most expensive and which airline is the least expensive?
How many flights cost above the average ticket prices? What are the peculiarities of these flights?
How are the prices varied according to the number of stops?
How are the prices varied according to the flight routes?
Are the prices of flight tickets affected by the airline?
What is the longest duration covered per airline and how does duration affect ticket prices?

Insights:
There are no 3-stop or 4-stop flights that cost below Rs.10,000. 
The chart reveals a variation across the 5 categories of flight ticket stops. 
For 1-stop flights, 50% cost below Rs.10,000. The top 25% of 1-stop flights cost between Rs.10000 and Rs.15,000. The maximum flight price across the 5 categories is from the 1-stop category, with a maximum of about Rs. 22,000. 
On the other hand, The cheapest flights are from the non-stop flight category.  All of the non-stop flights cost below Rs.10,000. 
Generally, the data shows a lot of outliers, especially across the non-stop, 1-stop, and 2-stop groups. It is worthy of note as these extreme values could distort the insights from the dataset. 
4-stop flights are the pricest, next are the 3-stop, 2-stop, 1-stop and least is the non-stop category.
Jet Airways has the highest number of stops, with a total of 3849 stops. 
Jet Airways also doubles as the most expensive flight recorded in this dataset. 
The airlines that offer the least number of stops in their itineraries are Trujet, Vistara Premium Economy, and Jet Airways Business with a record of a total of 1, 3, and 6 stops respectively.
